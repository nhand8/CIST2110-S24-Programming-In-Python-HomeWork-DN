### README
# This file contains buggy functions that you need to fix.
# There are 10 buggy functions in total.
# run test.py to see which functions are buggy and what the expected output is.
# remember you can run test.py with the -v flag to see more details about the tests.
# also remember that you can run a specific test by specifying the test name after the -k flag.
# you should not change the test.py file.

# Each function has a comment above it that describes what the function should do.
# Answer each question asking where the bug is in the buggy function.
# Provide your answer as what line the bug is on and what the bug is.
# For example, if the bug is on line 5 and the bug is that the function is missing a colon, you would write:
# 5: Missing colon
# After you fix the function, you should run test.py to make sure that the function is fixed.
